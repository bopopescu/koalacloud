# KOALA Cloud Manager

KOALA (Karlsruhe Open Application (for) cLoud Administration) is a software service, designed to help you working with your [http://aws.amazon.com](Amazon Web Services) (AWS) compatible cloud services and infrastructures (IaaS). The public cloud services from Amazon and the HP Cloud (that offering is now defunct!) are support as well as private cloud services based on [https://github.com/eucalyptus/eucalyptus](Eucalyptus), [https://github.com/nimbusproject/nimbus](Nimbus) or [https://github.com/OpenNebula/one](OpenNebula). The storage services [https://cloud.google.com/storage/](Google Cloud Storage), [https://www.dunkel.de/s3](Dunkel Cloud Storage) and Host Europe Cloud Storage (that offering is now defunct!) can be used with KOALA too

KOALA helps interacting with cloud services that implement the APIs of 

- [http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/](Elastic Compute Cloud) (EC2) 
- [http://aws.amazon.com/s3/](Simple Storage Service) (S3)
- [http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/](Elastic Block Store) (EBS) 
- [http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/](Elastic Load Balancing) (ELB)

With KOALA the users can start, stop and monitor their instances, volumes and elastic IP addresses. They can also create and erase buckets inside the S3-compatible storage services S3, Google Storage and Walrus. It's easy to upload, check and modify data that is stored inside these storage services, the same way it can be done with [http://www.s3fox.net](S3Fox) and the [https://sandbox.google.com/storage/](Google Storage Manager).

KOALA itself is a service that is able to run inside the public cloud platform (PaaS) [http://appengine.google.com](Google App Engine) and inside Private Cloud platforms with [https://github.com/AppScale/appscale](AppScale) or [http://code.google.com/p/typhoonae/](typhoonAE).

**A customized version for Android and iPhone/iPod touch devices is included.**
